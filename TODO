- enable custom error messages for validations
- figure out what to do for string inflections 
  (currently borrowing inflectors provided by pippa, perhaps i should break
   them apart and have 3 libraries, pippa, infelctors and sculpt, sculpt
   and pippa could both require iflectors)
- add more validations (many are just stubs atm)
- allow arguments to static function scopes
- write tests :)
